## Introduction

Much of what Built does is track money in and around construction projects. In this example, the code is an extremely simplified construction project budget. Assume that it is critical to our business.

In order to sustain our growth, we have a number of improvements to make - like migrating our legacy code to an API-first approach with a decoupled front-end.

[Disclaimer: neither this code nor the database is representative of what you will actually find at Built, but we're trying to cover both greenfield and brownfield development in 1 exercise. We believe this is simple enough to be approachable but complex enough to be indicative of your ability.]

## First task

Your first ticket is to write some CRUD endpoints for budget items. (You can find a simplified data model in the `backend/types` folder.) Simultaneously, write some components for the front-end to replace/improve the HTML output in `backend/projectBudget.ts`.

## Getting started

- In order to ensure compatibility with the installed dependencies, you are encouraged to use `nvm` ([install](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#node-version-manager---)) to run the project: `nvm use`
- You will need to install the dependencies: `npm install`

## Deliverables

1. Complete the [first task](#first-task) outlined above
1. Look at the domain and - as time allows - choose 1 or more follow-up tickets from the [backlog](backlog.md)
1. Create a GitHub repository and push your solution; share it with your interviewer
1. Include any documentation that may be helpful for starting the conversation in the follow-up interview
    - What important technical decisions did you make?

## Expected time investment

We hope that you can make meaningful progress towards this task in 90-120 minutes. That may not seem like a lot of time, but bear in mind that this work is just a starting point for a conversation about your code with your interviewer. It's not going to be perfect - no matter how much time you invest.

## Questions

### TODO: What should the candidate do if they have questions??
